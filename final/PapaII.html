  <h2> Lore:</h2>
  <p>Papa Emeritus II was the second frontman of Ghost during the Infestissumam and If You Have Ghost Cycle from 2012-2015. Like with <a href="PapaI.html">Papa I</a>, he's played by frontman and founding member Tobias Forge.</p>

<p>Papa II made his live debut on December 15, 2012 at a special show in the band's hometown of Linköping, Sweden. After Papa I passed the mic down to him, Papa II debut a new song with the band called Secular Haze.</p>

<p>Papa II is also the first papa to appear without facepaint. During the Year Zero video, the Papaganda videos, and the studio sessions at Music Feeds Studio he wore a version of the mask without facepaint. He wore sunglasses to hide the eye cuts.</p>

<p>Papa II was described as a miserable, wounded, and bitter old man. Some <a rel="nofollow" href="https://thebandghost.fandom.com/wiki/Nameless_Ghouls">ghouls</a> described him in interviews as being a "narcissist" and an "asshole". He was fired from the clergy due to not performing his duties in overthrowing churches and governments. On June 3, 2015, at a special hometown show in Linköping, Sweden, he was replaced by his "younger brother of three months", <a href="PapaIII.html">Papa Emeritus III</a>.</p>
