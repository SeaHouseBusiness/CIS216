  <h2> Lore:</h2>
<p>Papa Emeritus III was the third frontman of Ghost during the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gSsp7vasSA&list=OLAK5uy_mrez335Yse108P9uwGc-q_ZSs0oROL_Dw">Meliora</a> and <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqoyKzgkqR4&list=OLAK5uy_kLr7J5rFKAbB6eK9PYgjmexacC3t-9vGo&index=1">Popestar</a> cycle from 2015-2017. He's played by frontman and founding member Tobias Forge.</p>

<p>Papa III is the "younger brother by three months" of <a href="PapaII.html">Papa Emeritus II</a>. He made his live debut on June 3, 2015 at a special show in their hometown of Link√∂ping, Sweden. Papa II passed the mic down to his younger brother. Papa III and the ghouls played four new songs: From the Pinnacle to the Pit, Cirice, Majesty, and Absolution. Cirice also won the Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance in 2016.</p>

<p>Meliora was promoted through the Unholy/Unplugged tour accompinied by two <a rel="nofollow" href="https://thebandghost.fandom.com/wiki/Nameless_Ghouls">nameless ghouls</a>, where he debut his dressed down outfit and played a kazoo during the unplugged version of Ghuleh/Zombie Queen. They also did a world tour known as Black to the Future.</p>

<p>Papa III has two outfits. The first one was his pope outfit and a dressed down outfit he would wear during performances and public events. He originally had a different look during his debut performance, as he was sent the wrong mask by accident. He used the mask during the first two shows before switching to the more commonly known mask.</p>

<p>In September of 2016, they released a new song called Square Hammer off of their EP Popestar. They embarked on the North American Popestar tour. A year later, Papa III went out on tour with a new group of Nameless Ghouls. They did a European Popestar Tour, another North American Popestar tour, and even opened up for Iron Maiden on their Book of Souls tour.</p>

<p>Four music videos were released during his time in the band. The videos were Cirice, From the Pinnacle to the Pit, Square Hammer, and He Is.</p>

<p>Papa III's reign came to an end on September 30, 2017. While the band was performing Monstrance Clock, two men came up on stage and dragged Papa III away, ending the song abruptly. Soon after, two men came up on stage escorting an elderly papa using a cane and an oxygen mask named Papa Emeritus Zero (later known as <a rel="nofollow" href="https://thebandghost.fandom.com/wiki/Papa_Nihil">Papa Nihil</a>) who addressed the crowd: "The party is over. The middle ages have begun", before being escorted off stage. Papa Zero is later on revealed as being the father of <a href="PapaI.html">Papa I</a>, Papa II, and Papa III. At the end of Papa III's era, the band released a live album called: <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWtlZ_6TMyU&list=OLAK5uy_kG8PzHPsTw1pta3ZB64LtEGIYvLKBLrQs&index=1">Ceremony and Devotion</a>.</p>
